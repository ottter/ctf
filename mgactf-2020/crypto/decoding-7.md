# MGA CTF 2020 â€“ Decoding #7

* **Category:** Cryptography
* **Points:** 650

## Challenge

> You have heard the location of the hacker's meeting is being posted around town. 
Can you find the flag that gives the address? (use the attached file to solve this challenge)

## Solution

We were given a QR code which led to the following encrypted text. A lot of stress and a big hint later nad I discovered
that this one used Citrix CTX1 encryption. A quick decode in [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) later and I found the flag!
