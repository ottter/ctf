# MGA CTF 2020

This is the first Capture tha Flag competition that I fully competed in. I'm 
making this write-up so I can always come back later and review what I did and 
how I did it. I'm likely not going to enter all of the challenges, just the ones 
that I found particularly interesting or challenging.

I think I am only going to put up the ones that I solved and/or the ones that I put 
a lot of time in to.
