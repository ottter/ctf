## Challenge

> We can't figure out what this file does, but we are sure it outputs a flag in some way. Please find the flag. 
Download the file from here: [REDACTED]

## Solution

**My method:** Normally the first thing I do is open up a hex editor and search for specific keywords. In this case, `mga`,
`ctf`, and `mgactf` are always the first I look for. Next I searched for `flag` and got a hit.
