## Solution

Honestly this one took me ages and only because I am stubborn. I saw this ~~wonderful~~ programming language show up 
while I was looking for codes that use 5 characters and had a friend mention it while I was complaining about how stuck 
I was. At one point I was taking whats in the `[]` and sliding it down until I found a match in the `><`. 
Brainlet move I guess.
