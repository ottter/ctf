# MGA CTF 2020 â€“ Key Checker

* **Category:** Enumeration and Exploitation
* **Points:** 200

## Challenge

> While performing a routine inspection of our systems we came across this license checker that prints a 
flag if you enter a valid license, see if you can reverse engineer it and get the flag. 
Lucky for you disassembling it and reading assembly code will not be required because we also found the source code :) 
(use the attached and linked files to solve this challenge) 

## Solution



```
The flag.
