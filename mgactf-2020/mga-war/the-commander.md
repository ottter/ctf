* **Category:** Middle Georgia Wars
* **Points:** 150 / 100 / 150 / 100

## Challenge

> The Commander, Dr. Yerby has again and again proved that he is the best forensics investigator that we 
have got. He is currently on a mission to expose Bictor HamFord. It is said that Dr. Yerby once saw Bictor 
and almost hacked into his AOL account (yes, AOL, this was back in their days...). The Commander is away 
from the screen currently and we have a reason to believe that some of his files have been compromised. 
The team has taken a acquired his computer files and stored it in the .raw format for you to investigate 
it. Use your forensics software and skills to find the corrupt document and files. The copy of the .raw 
file can be found on [REDACTED]. We don't know if you'll need the username and password. If you do, the 
commander's username and password are: Username: Commander PW: forensicsthebest
