# MGA CTF 2020 â€“ Amber Leader

* **Category:** Middle Georgia Wars
* **Points:** 150

## Challenge

> We have just received a message from the Amber Squadron Leader, Prof. Pedro. 
Please view the message he has sent and find out the flag. Message: [REDACTED LINK]

## Solution

Instead of a compiled file like in [hidden.exe](../exploits/hidden-exe-flag.md), I just had to go in to the 
folder and look through Form1.cs for the flag.
