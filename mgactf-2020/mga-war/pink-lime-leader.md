# MGA CTF 2020 – Pink and Lime Leader

* **Category:** Middle Georgia Wars
* **Points:** 50 / 50 / 70 / 85 / 85 / 100 / 100 / 120 / 120

## Challenge

> Pink and Lime Leaders are one of the best strategists we have got. Brooke Ingram and Trisha Purser help the 
members devise a plan for the future. These two squadron leaders are responsible for placing members with their 
respective squadron. Recently we learnt that cruel Bictor Hamford and his Middle Georgia Pirate Company intercepted 
the traffic a traffic. We are not sure if they the MGPC was eavesdropping on Pink and Lime Leaders or someone else. 
The only evidence we have is a pcap file we received from one of our undercover agents. Your mission is to find 
all the possible details of the file. 

## Solution

I didn't save the specific questions for this one. Honestly if I am coming back in here in the future for guidance,
just learn how to use Wireshark. It was all fairly straightforward.
