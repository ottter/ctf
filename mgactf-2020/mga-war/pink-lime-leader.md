members devise a plan for the future. These two squadron leaders are responsible for placing members with their 
respective squadron. Recently we learnt that cruel Bictor Hamford and his Middle Georgia Pirate Company intercepted

The only evidence we have is a pcap file we received from one of our undercover agents. Your mission is to find 
all the possible details of the file.
