## Challenge

> We came across this page, see if you can find a flag. Link: [REDACTED]

## Solution

The first thing to do on any website is to `F12` to check out the comments. 

![Tribute 1](../IMAGES/web-tribute1.png)

Bingo! Now we navigate over from `/web1/index.html` over to `/web1/log.txt` and see what is there. 

![Tribute 2](../IMAGES/web-tribute2.png)

Perfect. Now over to `/web1/fonts/flag.txt` for the flag
